# Information and How to Install
Thank you for downloading my humble configs! They aren't much but they work for me!
## Information

This holds my configs for my build of i3-gaps and all the dependencies. All the config files will be sent to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/.config`. Some of the config folders may not be necesary depending on if you install all the packages or only the needed ones, but for now I can't be bothered to change that.

## To install:

use `git clone https://github.com/roman1267/Configs.git` in your home directory to start the process. Pacman will prompt you a few times to continue; choose yes or no at your on discretion.
