# Information and How to Install
Thank you for downloading my humble configs! They aren't much but they work for me!
## Information

This holds my configs for my build of i3-gaps and all the dependencies. All the config files will be sent to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/.config`

## To install:

use `git pull https://github.com/roman1267/Configs.git` in your home directory to start the process. Pacman will prompt you a few times to continue; choose yes or no at your on discretion.
